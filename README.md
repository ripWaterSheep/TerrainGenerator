# TerrainGenerator

Generate infinite terrain using perlin noise.
Elevation, climate, and clouds are based on separate noisemaps.


## Requirements
* Processing
* PeasyCam library for processing (sketch -> import library -> add library -> peasycam).

## Controls
* WASD to offset noise (creates moving effect)
* 1 and 2 to morph terrain height noise
* 3 and 4 to morph climate noise
* r to randomize noise seed and regenerate new terrain
* left click and drag to rotate
* scroll mouse or right click and drag to zoom in
* drag center mouse button to pan
